# NetCoin (NTC) Documentation

NetCoin is a revolutionary decentralized network that combines blockchain consensus with global routing infrastructure. Using PoNW (Proof of Network), it creates an energy-backed economy where contributing to the network earns tokens that power premium services.

## What is NetCoin?

NetCoin implements Jason Lowery's Softwar vision by making computational energy productive. Taking inspiration from Bitcoin's great design, NetCoin embeds brute-force puzzles directly into Mycelium's routing decisions, proving energy through useful network work.

### Key Innovation: Proof of Network
- **Energy Verification**: PoW puzzles tied to packet forwarding
- **Useful Computation**: Routing optimizations serve real network utility
- **Fair Economy**: Earn NTC by routing; spend on premium services
- **Premium Aliases**: Buy unique @names with earned NTC

## Quick Start

### Run a Node
```bash
git clone https://github.com/netcoin-ntc/netcoin.git
cd netcoin
make deploy
```

### Earn NTC
Running a NetCoin node contributes routing capacity and earns NTC proportional to energy spent.

### Use Premium Services
Access QoS routing, VPN tunnels, and secure channels with your earned NTC.

## Network Overview

NetCoin operates on a separate IPv6 subnet (0x500::/7) from standard Mycelium, ensuring dedicated PoN infrastructure.

- **Free Access**: Basic routing for all participants
- **Premium Features**: Enhanced services paid in NTC
- **Decentralized**: No central providers or single points of failure
