# Netcoin Features

## Core Features

### PoNW (Proof of Network) Consensus
- Embeds PoW puzzles directly into Mycelium routing decisions
- Energy verification without hackable sensors
- Proves computational energy through useful network work

### Energy-Backed Economy
- NTC tokens represent verified physical energy
- Earn by routing; spend on premium services
- Fair meritocracy: energy input = value output

### Decentralized Networking
- Built on Mycelium's planetary-scale overlay
- Separate subnet (0x500::/7) for PoN network
- Automatic routing with PoW integration

## User Features

### For Node Operators
- Earn NTC by contributing routing capacity
- Hardware-agnostic (phones to servers)
- Automatic difficulty adjustment

### For Consumers
- Free basic routing access
- Premium services with NTC:
  - QoS routing (low-latency guarantees)
  - VPN tunnels (encrypted private networks)
  - Bandwidth boost (higher throughput)
  - Secure channels (tamper-proof communication)
  - Custom routing (user-defined paths)

### For Developers
- Open-source Rust implementation
- Docker deployment
- API for custom integrations

### Alias System
- **Free Addresses**: Auto-generated @hash addresses for all users
- **Premium Aliases**: Paid human-readable @names (e.g., @johnsmith)
- **Unique Registration**: NTC payment for alias ownership
- **Economic Incentive**: Drives NTC usage and network value

### Command Line Interface
- **Wallet Management**: Create, balance, send commands
- **Alias Operations**: Register and check premium aliases
- **Node Control**: Start mining, view network status
- **Production Ready**: Persistent storage and error handling

## Technical Features

### Security
- 51% attack resistance via energy barriers
- Sybil protection through PoW requirements
- DDoS mitigation via distributed routing

### Privacy
- Ring signatures for anonymous transactions
- @username aliases for addresses
- End-to-end encryption via Mycelium

### Scalability
- Light client support for mobile devices
- Automatic peer discovery
- Efficient PoW puzzles (adjustable difficulty)

## Ecosystem Features

### Wallet & Transactions
- Built-in NTC wallet
- Energy-based transaction fees
- Cross-platform support (Linux/macOS/Windows/mobile)

### Governance
- On-chain voting weighted by routing contributions
- Decentralized decision-making

### Interoperability
- Future cross-chain bridges
- API for third-party services
